			<string>Baskerville</string>
			<key>Paragraph1</key>
			<string>John Baskerville was born in Worcestershire, near Birmingham, England in 1706. He developed an affinity for letterforms at an early age and by twenty-three he was teaching students penmanship and quickly becoming a skilled engraver of headstones. In 1738 Baskerville entered the japanning trade, where luxury goods were adorned with a decorative lacquer, and within a decade he had become a wealthy man with his own estate.</string>
			<key>Paragraph2</key>
			<string>By the late 1740s Baskerville’s interests turned to printing and he hired the punchcutter John Hardy to help him establish a printing press. For seven years, backed by the continued success of his japanning business, Baskerville experimented with every aspect of the printing process, before finally settling on a type design and printing technique that met his high standards.</string>
			<key>Paragraph3</key>
			<string>The Baskerville typeface was based upon Baskerville’s preferred handwriting, and has become known as one of the first designs in the transitional style. Transitional typefaces have thinner serifs than their predecessors in the old-style, and a greater contrast between thick and thin strokes. These contrasts in stroke help to define Baskerville’s shape, making it more legible than old-style typefaces such as Caslon. Baskerville’s typeface achieved a delicacy previously unseen and appeared crisp on the page, making it ideal for large volumes of text. Perhaps the most notable character in Baskerville’s typeface is the famous uppercase Q, its tail a flourish from his past as a writing master, however the lowercase g is also notable for its unclosed lower bowl and curled ear. Baskerville’s perfectionism required him to inspect Hardy’s punches with a microscope to ensure their quality, and he refused to use the same punchcut for more than one printing run.</string>
			<key>Paragraph4</key>
			<string>Baskerville made numerous innovations to the printing process when he realised that contemporary techniques did not not reach his high standards. The printing press, which had changed little since its invention in 1450 by Johannes Gutenberg gave unreliable results. Baskerville’s answer was to replace the uneven wooden bed and platen of his flat-bed printing press with a 1 inch thick brass sheet for better pressure distribution. Coupled with this Baskerville used a firm cushion of fine cloth, known as a tympan, to achieve a shallow impression on the paper. Baskerville’s choice of paper was also unique. Contemporaries used uneven laid mould paper, but Baskerville championed the use of wove mould paper, invented by Birmingham papermaker James Whatman. Using paper fibres woven together like a textile, paper reached a newfound smoothness, and the technique is still the dominant form of paper making today.</string>
			<key>Paragraph5</key>
			<string>Not stopping there, Baskerville created a complex recipe for his inks that were far more viscous than the traditionally used inks of the time. Once this ink was printed onto paper, the paper was then pressed between two heated copper plates to remove moisture, further flattening the paper. The results of this technique seem mundane by today’s standards, but it allowed Baskerville’s press to produce books exhibiting a greater finesse than those created by his contemporaries.</string>
			<key>Paragraph6</key>
			<string>It wouldn’t be until 1757 that Baskerville would be ready to showcase his new typeface and printing techniques in the book, &lt;italic&gt;Bucolics and Georgics of Virgil&lt;/italic&gt;. Unsurprisingly this book was expensive, and though it sold well enough for Baskerville to continue printing, his perfectionism which required the printing of 2000 books to only sell the best 1500, was untenable quality control for the time.</string>
			<key>Paragraph7</key>
			<string>The masterful work of an amateur such as Baskerville annoyed his British contemporaries, who claimed that his thin letterforms and dazzling white paper caused strain on the reader. Even Baskerville’s magnum opus, a printing of &lt;italic&gt;The Holy Bible&lt;/italic&gt; in 1763, which in the words of historian Daniel Berkeley Updike “went forth to astonish all the librarians of Europe”, was met with indifference.</string>
			<key>Paragraph8</key>
			<string>The distaste for Baskerville at the time was compounded by his “eccentric” personality. An ardent atheist, he publicly ridiculed organised religion, declaring it “the most impudent abuse of common sense which ever was invented to befool mankind”. His relations with Sarah Eaves, his housekeeper who was ostensibly his wife, caused further controversy, as she was still married to a man who had deserted her. Shunned by the typographic society of Britain, towards the end of his life Baskerville had been looking to sell his press.</string>
			<key>Paragraph9</key>
			<string>Thankfully Baskerville’s work met greater success in Europe and North America. His work inspired a young Giambattista Bodoni, and Pierre Simon Fournier, inventor of the typographical point mentioned that Baskerville and his types “spared neither pains nor expense to bring them to the utmost pitch of perfection.’ Benjamin Franklin, a close friend of Baskerville lobbied unsuccessfully for the &lt;italic&gt;United States Declaration of Independence&lt;/italic&gt; to be set in Baskerville, but did manage to have it used for various government documents.</string>
			<key>Paragraph10</key>
			<string>When Baskerville died in 1775 aged 69, at his insistence he was buried in the mausoleum on his grounds, where he was joined 13 years later by his widow Sarah Eaves who had continued his printing commitments. Having no heirs their estate fell into several different hands, and eventually a canal was constructed through the mausoleum. Nobody claimed his lead coffin and it eventually ended up in a warehouse for 8 years, before being moved to yet another warehouse, where the smell began to cause disruption. His coffin was snuck into a church graveyard, unmarked for 50 years before it was found and a marker was erected. Unfortunately this church has now been demolished and the entrance to the crypt bricked over.</string>
			<key>Paragraph11</key>
			<string>Baskerville’s printing press and punches suffered a better fate. Sold to a French nobleman they were taken to Germany and printed the complete works of Voltaire, (the writings of whom were banned in France), before being used to print pamphlets supporting the French Revolution. They were then confiscated by the French government, sold to a private firm and put to work for the better part of a century, before finally being gifted to Cambridge University as an historical artefact in 1953.</string>
			<key>Paragraph12</key>
			<string>By striving for perfection Baskerville revolutionised the printing process. Despite being scorned by his contemporaries, it didn’t take long for Baskerville’s innovations to be become standard practice, and eventually his genius was recognised in Britain. The turn of the 20th century revitalised the Baskerville typeface thanks to the private press movement as well as the work of Stanley Morison and Bruce Rogers. In the digital age most foundries have multiple versions of Baskerville available, ranging from more traditional designs to those adapted for usability, and Baskerville is also inspiring new designs, such as Mrs. Eaves by Zuzana Licko. As was John Baskerville’s way, perseverance eventually proved him to be one of the worlds greatest typographers.</string>

			<string>Futura</string>
			<key>Paragraph1</key>
			<string>Though not the first, Paul Renner’s Futura has come to define geometric sans-serif typefaces. Rejecting Germanic tradition and blackletter type design, Renner reduced letter-forms to their most basic elements and created “the typeface of our time”.</string>
			<key>Paragraph2</key>
			<string>Paul Renner was born on August 9th, 1878 in Wernigerode Prussia, now Germany, and received a traditional Protestant upbringing. After going through the middle class ‘Gymnasium’ education system as a teen, Renner studied at several several art academies, intending to make his living as a painter. However after attending meetings held by by the &lt;italic&gt;Deutscher Werkbund&lt;/italic&gt;, The German Association of Craftsmen, Renner changed careers, realising “his desire to bring industry and art together to create visually appealing things”.</string>
			<key>Paragraph3</key>
			<string>The Werkbund aimed to form “a rallying point for all those who are able and willing to work for high quality” by promoting and practicing the unity of industrial mass production techniques with traditional craft techniques. They believed that by “selecting the best representatives of art, industry, crafts and trades” Germany would be able to compete internationally with products being made in England and the United States of America. After joining Renner became familiar with the publishers and compositors of Munich, and in 1908 at the age of 30 Renner became a book designer for the Munich Publishing Trade. While there he established “a new set of standards for quality book design”, and explored typography in his 1922 book &lt;italic&gt;Typografie als Kunst, Typography As Art&lt;/italic&gt;.</string>
			<key>Paragraph4</key>
			<string>Like almost all Germanic literature of the time, &lt;italic&gt;Typografie als Kunst&lt;/italic&gt; was set in blackletter, which Renner was initially fond of. However the end of The First World War brought new ideas and experiments from German artists who sought to distance themselves from tradition. Renner was conservative, but by 1924 he had become unhappy with the calligraphic nature of blackletter, and found Roman designs inconsistent between upper and lowercase, which was unsuitable due to the heavy use of capitals in the German language. Concerned with the legibility and functionality of type, Renner began experimenting with abstract ideas and designs which would eventually become Futura.</string>
			<key>Paragraph5</key>
			<string>Futura was to be an industrial typeface for an industrial age, and Renner’s initial designs strictly adhered to the laws of compass and rule, resulting in geometric forms that are more architectural than functional. In his rejection of blackletter, Renner sought to remove all handwritten characteristics of his typeface, believing that a machine could not, and should not attempt to “transplant the forms of the handcraft on to machine-made products”. However, Futura would eventually become more of a “transitional force” between the traditional and modern typefaces. Renner’s humanist tendencies caused him to compromise his initial aims for a more legible typeface. For instance, what may initially seem like a perfect circle, such as the bowls on a p are carefully shaped for optimised legibility, showing Renner’s mastery of design.</string>
			<key>Paragraph6</key>
			<string>Futura was so successful upon its release in 1927 that it overshadowed all the other geometric sans-serifs that came before it, appearing to most observers “to be superior in every way”. It was quickly expanded upon until there were light, book, regular, medium, demi bold and bold versions, an unusual occurrence at the time due to the man power required. Though some criticised the increasing popularity of geometric sans-serifs such as Erbar and Futura as “block letters for block-heads”, with other typefaces such as Kabal and Gill Sans following soon after Futura’s release, typographic design was changed forever.</string>
			<key>Paragraph7</key>
			<string>Unfortunately the rise of Nazism in Germany initially caused a revival in blackletter typefaces. Renner was an outspoken critic of the Nazi party, even going so far as to publish &lt;italic&gt;Kultur-bolschewismus?, Cultural Bolshevism?&lt;/italic&gt; in 1932. Unsurprisingly when the Nazi’s took power in 1933 Renner was labeled an “intellectual subversive” and forced to resign from his position at the Printing Trade School. Rather than flee, Renner went into self-imposed exile and focused his time on design, in 1939 creating the influential book &lt;italic&gt;Die Kunst der Typographie&lt;/italic&gt;. He worked up until his death in 1956, always trying to combine craft and industry.</string>

		<key>Gill Sans</key>

			<key>Title</key>
			<string>Gill Sans</string>
			<key>Paragraph1</key>
			<string>Named after its creator Eric Gill, few typefaces are as controversial as Gill Sans. “Perhaps the greatest English artist-craftsman of the twentieth century”, Gill was an accomplished sculptor, stonecutter, printmaker and typographer, whose work intertwined the spiritual and secular. However, Gill’s pedophilloic relationship with his daughters has left a stain on his name and subsequently his work.</string>
			<key>Paragraph2</key>
			<string>Eric Gill was born on the 22nd of February, 1882 in Brighton England. He was one of thirteen children, and though raised in a strict religious household where money was tight Gill describes it as “unusually happy”. At the age of 18 he completed his studies at the Chichester Technical and Art School and moved to London to train as an architect, but quickly became dispirited with his training. To distract himself Gill began studying stone masonry at Westminster Technical Institute, and took calligraphy classes at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. These calligraphy classes introduced Gill to the master calligrapher and typographer Edward Johnston who would go on to design the typeface for the London Underground, and whose talents left Gill “struck as by lightning”.</string>
			<key>Paragraph3</key>
			<string>By 1909 at the age of twenty-seven Gill had started a family and become a respected letter-cutter and monumental mason with a steady stream of work and clients. One evening however, in an attempt to relieve himself of boredom while his wife was pregnant Gill had begun sculpting, using his confidence from letter cutting to chisel directly into the stone, rather than use the modelling and machining process that was popular at the time. Previously Gill had shied away from sculpting, contracting others to sculpt if it was needed for a commission, but his first creations were well received by his friends and Gill began his life as the artist craftsman.</string>
			<key>Paragraph4</key>
			<string>Though Gill’s sculpting work brought him much renown, he continued to work in a variety of mediums. Gill frequently supplied illustrations and wood engravings to The Golden Cockerel Press,  a famous printing workshop of classic literature. Through The Golden Cockerel Press Gill made the acquaintance of the venerable Stanley Morison, creator of Times New Roman and Typographic Adviser to the Monotype Corporation. Morison was impressed by Gill’s letter cutting and commissioned him to create typeface designs for Monotype. Gill’s first creation would be Perpetua in 1925, which was based on Roman inscriptions. Perpetua so impressed Morison he proclaimed that the typeface had the “finest capitals ever done since Sixtus the Fifth - 1589”.</string>
			<key>Paragraph5</key>
			<string>Gill Sans originated as a simple fascia board for the “forward-minded bookseller of Bristol” Douglas Cleverdon. However when Morison spotted the design he requested Gill turn it into a complete typeface. Gill Sans is a clear revision of Edward Johnston’s London Underground typeface, which Gill deemed “not entirely satisfactory”, as a typeface should be “fool proof”. Despite Gill’s belief that his designs would be “absolutely legible-to-the-last-degress-letters”, it is notable that Gill San’s breaks many of these self imposed rules. For instance the 1, i and l characters in Johnston’s Underground are all distinct designs, while in Gill Sans they are indistinguishable. Furthermore Gill insults type that aims to representations ideas, such as “comic modern varieties [which have] more relation to pairs of spectacles than to lettering”, but Gill Sans most famous character is a lowercase g which resembles a pair of spectacles.</string>
			<key>Paragraph6</key>
			<string>Upon its official release in 1929 Gill Sans became “an almost instant success”, over time being adopted by The British Government, The London &amp; North Eastern Railway, Penguin Books and the BBC among others. Monotype intended Gill Sans “to be the British counterpart to the Futura design”, and marketed it as the typeface of Great Britain, stating that it “does not look, foreign in origins or exotic in design”. However as Gill Sans grew in popularity it also grew in size. Increasingly larger designs were commissioned, causing Gill to lament that “every advertisement has to try and shout down its neighbours”. Now Gill Sans ranges from ultra light to ultra bold fonts that can have little in relation to each other.</string>
			<key>Paragraph7</key>
			<string>When using Gill Sans, one must decide if they can separate what was made by the hands of Eric Gill from Eric Gill himself. Gill had a curious and insatiable sexual appetite, his multiple extramarital affairs and incestuous relationship with his sister were well known, and for many years treated as merely footnotes in his eccentric life as an artist. However the work of biographer Fiona MacCarthy uncovered Gill’s sexual relationships with his two eldest daughters during their teenage years, not to mention experiments with a dog. When questioned about these actions, Petra Gill stated that her family “just took it for granted”, and that she felt no shame. Regardless, Gill abused his responsibilities as a parent and partook in acts that would surely put him in jail now, as well as in his own time. Does this knowledge make Gill’s typefaces tainted and unusable, or being essentially tools, do they stand apart from the man who made them? Each designer must come to their own opinion.</string>

			<string>Palatino</string>
			<key>Paragraph1</key>
			<string>Hermann Zapf was born on the 8th of November, 1918 in Nuremberg, Germany. His early life was harsh, food was scarce in post-war Germany, and an endemic of spanish flu killed two of his siblings. As he grew older Zapf wished to become an electrical engineer, having shown an interest in technology from an early age. However his father was heavily involved in the unions and had become blacklisted by the Nazi party, stamping out Zapf’s hopes of attending college. Recognising his natural drawing skills, Zapf’s teachers suggested that he find work as an apprentice lithographer. Unfortunately political questioning during the interview process resulted in constant rejections, despite the quality of his work. It would take 10 months of searching until Zapf found a job with the “the last company in the telephone directory” as a retoucher, despite not knowing what the job would entail.</string>
			<key>Paragraph2</key>
			<string>During Zapf’s apprenticeship he attended an exhibition in memory of the late master calligrapher Rudolf Koch. He was so impressed that he began teaching himself calligraphy from the books of Koch and Edward Johnston. Zapf would regularly practice long into the night, annoying his parents with the overuse of the electric light, and despite holding his pen incorrectly for the first three years of his calligraphy studies Zapf was a natural. Zapf’s calligraphic skills were so great that he regularly had to stay late at his apprenticeship, fixing the mistakes made by full time work colleagues.</string>
			<key>Paragraph3</key>
			<string>Upon completion of his apprenticeship, but without his journeyman certificate Zapf moved to Frankfurt, applying his calligraphic skills at the Werkstatt Haus zum Fürstwneck on typography and songbooks. Zapf then went on to designing the fraktur typeface Gildengart for the D. Stempel AG type foundry in 1938. Unfortunately the life of Gilgengart was cut short when the Nazi party declared fraktur type “a Jewish concoction”, and soon after Zapf was drafted into the German army. Zapf struggled with the hard labour and was clumsy with the artillery, resulting in his transfer to Bordeaux to work as a cartographer, drawing maps of Spain and its railway system. Here Zapf impressed his senior officers with his ability to write 1mm large script without glasses or magnifying glasses, and its likely these skills kept him away from the front for the remainder of the war.</string>
			<key>Paragraph4</key>
			<string>After the war Zapf taught calligraphy for a year before returning to the Stempel type foundry as artistic head of the in-house printshop in 1947. While there he worked on book designs, continued to teach calligraphy and married Gudrun von Hesse, a teacher who herself was a successful typographer, calligrapher and book-binder. One of Zapf’s most notable publications was &lt;italic&gt;Feder und Stichel&lt;/italic&gt;, a small book of alphabet designs that featured the first appearance of Palatino as the typeface for its introductory text. Though only 580 copies were printed, &lt;italic&gt;Feder und Stichel&lt;/italic&gt; gained international renown as a marvel of the calligrapher’s art, thrusting both Palatino and Zapf into the limelight.</string>
			<key>Paragraph5</key>
			<string>Inspired by Italian Renaissance letterforms and named after the master calligrapher Gaimbattista Palatino, Zapf’s Palatino typeface embodies a vitality that was much much desired after World War 2. Highly legible thanks to its elegant light lines and large character size, Palatino is the result of careful studies by both Zapf and the punch cutter August Rosenberger. Weights of the serifs and strokes were carefully scrutinised, and the famous open counters stem from practical considerations to reduce the smudging caused by the poor quality paper available in Germany at the time.</string>
			<key>Paragraph6</key>
			<string>Palatino’s beauty makes it suitable for both design and long form text. Due to its immense success, Palatino has been adapted for almost every typesetting technology available and iterated upon several times. The Palatino family now includes Latin, Greek and Cyrillic characters, as well as an extensive amount of symbols, all created by Zapf himself. Unfortunately success has plagued Palatino with piracy. In most countries the law states that only the name of a typeface can be registered, but its design is unpatentable and therefore in the public domain. Monotypes Book Antiqua shares the same character width, spacing and kerning as Palatino, and there are countless other copies such as Pontiac, Paladium, Andover, Malibu and Elgante. Piracy of Zapf’s designs became so bad that he considered quitting his work as a type designer.</string>

			<string>Times New Roman</string>
			<key>Paragraph1</key>
			<string>Functional design is the lifeblood of Times New Roman, possibly the most read typeface in the world. Lacking any embellishments, eccentricities or particularly notable characters it was the perfect typeface to bring &lt;italic&gt;The Times of London&lt;/italic&gt; newspaper into the modern world.</string>
			<key>Paragraph2</key>
			<string>The father of Times New Roman was Stanley Morison, a titan of the typographic world who came from humble beginnings. Born on May 6th, 1889 in Wanstead, near Essex England, he was one of many children and was largely self taught, having to leave school at 14 to support the family which his father had abandoned.</string>
			<key>Paragraph3</key>
			<string>By the age of twenty-three Morison was an unhappy bank clerk working in London when he saw an advert in &lt;italic&gt;The Times&lt;/italic&gt; for &lt;italic&gt;The Imprint&lt;/italic&gt;, a new magazine that aimed to bring printing “to its worthy place among the crafts”. Soon after Morison became an editorial assistant, teaching him the craft of printing and typography. However &lt;italic&gt;The Imprint&lt;/italic&gt; would only last nine issues, and by 1916 conscription was introduced in Britain to bolster their efforts in the First World War. Morison became a conscientious objector on religious and moral grounds, but his appeal was rejected and he spent two years in jail before being interned as a farm hand until the end of the war.</string>
			<key>Paragraph4</key>
			<string>After the First World War Morison joined his friend Francis Meynell at the Pelican Press as design supervisor. The Pelican Press was set up by Meynell to “do good printing for the daily, not the exceptional, purpose”, and they primarily focussed on printing marketing materials and political pamphlets. However Morison was given the opportunity to write and produce &lt;italic&gt;The Craft of Printing: Notes on the History of Type Forms&lt;/italic&gt;, one of the first substantial essays to study the history and art of type design. Morison then moved to the Cloister Press, before co-founding the Fleuron Society, a fleuron being a typographical flower or an ornamental design. The Fleuron, for which Morison was the editor, became a world renowned journal on typographical matters, featuring essays and specimens showcasing the work of world renowned typographers old and new.</string>
			<key>Paragraph5</key>
			<string>Morison’s experience made him ideal for the role as typographic consultant at the Monotype Corporation. Still operating today, Monotype is famous for the Monotype machine, a specialised device for composition and hot metal casting that significantly improved the speed and consistency of printed work. Needing typefaces for their machines, the Monotype Corporation is also a type foundry, however in 1923 they lacked diversity and were risk averse when considering new designs. Morison in his new role spearheaded a new initiative to boost the credibility of Monotype as a type foundry, reviving historical designs, which he saw “as a programme of typographical design, rational, systematic and corresponding effectively with the foreseeable needs of printing.” Morison’s typographic renaissance is famous for reintroducing classic designs such as Bodoni and Baskerville to the printing world.</string>
			<key>Paragraph6</key>
			<string>In 1929, now forty, Morison published the scathing article &lt;italic&gt;Newspaper Types: A Study of The Times&lt;/italic&gt; which criticised the famous newspaper’s poor printing, outdated typography and inconsistent design. The article resulted in &lt;italic&gt;The Times&lt;/italic&gt; approaching the Monotype Corporation and commissioning Morison to design a new typeface. Morison set out to bring The Times to “the standard obtaining in the average book as brought out by London publishers”.</string>
			<key>Paragraph7</key>
			<string>In the last edition of The Fleuron, Morison’s famous essay &lt;italic&gt;First Principles of Book Typography&lt;/italic&gt;, clarified what he believed was correct composition and type design. He encouraged a restraint on the part of the printer when arranging type, and believed that “every character, every word, every line should be seen with maximum clearness”. Morison advised that ornamentation and typographical distraction were to be avoided so as not to weaken the author’s message. These ideas, which Morison had developed over his career, were the basis for &lt;italic&gt;The Typography of The Times&lt;/italic&gt;, a historical survey where Morison set out his aims for redesigning &lt;italic&gt;The Times&lt;/italic&gt; newspaper. Due to the compact columns of a broadsheet newspaper, legibility and clarity were paramount to the new design, and Morison looked for inspiration in the work of his competitors. One such design was Mergenthaler Linotype’s Ionic No. 5, which having been cut in 1926 and designed to withstand the harsh printing conditions of the day had been an immediate success.</string>
			<key>Paragraph8</key>
			<string>The origins of the Times New Roman design are unclear. Morison stated that Times New Roman is based of Robert Granjon’s 16th century typeface Plantin, among others, despite Morison believing that The Times typeface was outdated. However typographer Mike Parker believes that Times New Roman may be based upon type designs by William Starling Burgess, who sent samples to the Monotype corporation in the early 1900s and never saw them returned.</string>
			<key>Paragraph9</key>
			<string>Regardless of the original inspiration, Morison was a designer, not a draughtsman. Writing in &lt;italic&gt;A Tally of Types&lt;/italic&gt;, Morison said that he “penciled the original set of drawings, and handed them to Victor Lardent”, an employee in &lt;italic&gt;The Times&lt;/italic&gt; advertising department and whom Morison considered to have “An unusually firm and lean line”. Once Lardent’s drawings met Morison’s strict requirements, the designs were cut into punches by the Monotype Corporation, and it was on the 3rd of October, 1932 that Times New Roman made its grand unveiling to the world as the typeface of &lt;italic&gt;The Times&lt;/italic&gt;.</string>
			<key>Paragraph10</key>
			<string>Times New Roman is clear and legible at small sizes and in large paragraphs. Its short ascenders and descenders result in less vertical space, which combined with a tight serif design make it ideal for newspaper printings. This compact design allowed the designer to fit more content on a page, saving them paper and ultimately money. Morison, like Baskerville before him, considered every part of the printing process, and Times New Roman was designed to take advantage of the high quality paper that &lt;italic&gt;The Times&lt;/italic&gt; newspaper used, which gave the typeface a remarkable degree of contrast.</string>
			<key>Paragraph11</key>
			<string>Some have critiqued Times New Roman’s lack of personality, however creating an almost invisible typeface was Morison’s aim, he believed that type should be a vehicle for the message of the text and that, “the typographers only purpose is to express, not himself, but his author”. Over the years Times New Roman has been adapted to Greek and Cyrillic, and expanded with countless variations, weights and characters for use across the globe. &lt;italic&gt;The Times&lt;/italic&gt; newspaper however has moved on. After 40 years of use the venerable typeface was replaced in 1972 with Times Europa, a sturdier design that can withstand faster presses on cheaper paper. Times Europa has since been replaced several times, with &lt;italic&gt;The Times&lt;/italic&gt; currently using Times Modern. However, “the transparent typeface” that is Times New Roman, has flourished in book and magazine printing, as well as desktop publishing with its calm authority and practicality.</string>
